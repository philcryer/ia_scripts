ia_digestion.sh
===============
ia_digestion.sh downloads files from the Internet Archive, using the file target_urls to define what needs to be grabbed, and then checks them into a Fedora-commons digital repository.  Edit ia_digestion.sh and ensure all the variables are set the way you need, then just figure out the ID Title of the files you need, put that on a new line in target_urls and run ./ia_digestion.sh

TODO: integrate Solr to allow adding object to Solr after FC ingest


ia_search.sh
============
a proof of concept REST based search script against Internet Archive.  Just run it providing an arguement of the thing you're searching for.  As an example: `./ia_search.sh vanderslice` would give you a list of the first occurance of Vanderslice in the IA.

TODO: allow for search strings >1 in length, format output, etc.
